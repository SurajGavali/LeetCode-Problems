# LeetCode Problems

This repository contains Java solutions for LeetCode problems of all difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard. Each problem is solved in a separate Java file named according to the pattern `Problem_<Number>.java` (for example, `Problem_3442.java`).

## Structure
- Problems are organized by difficulty in folders: `Easy`, `Medium`, and `Hard`.
- Each Java file contains:
  - The full solution code
  - A comment at the top with a link to the original LeetCode problem statement

## How to Use
- Browse the respective difficulty folder to find problems by their number.
- Open the Java file to see the solution and the problem link for reference.
- Example file naming: `Problem_1.java`, `Problem_3442.java`, etc.

## Example
```java
// filepath: /LeetCode-Problems/Easy/Problem_3442.java
// https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-difference-between-even-and-odd-frequency-i/description/
public class Problem_3442 {
